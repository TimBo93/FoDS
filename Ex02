2.3 (a)
Yes, it implements Uniform Causal Order because it says these lines:
[Partial algorithm from slides]
	p has prev. executed deliverCA(m’) ∀ m’ ∈ D
	then
	deliverCA(m)
	prevDlvrs := prevDlvrs ∪ {m}
	else
	discard m
That tells if m' is delivered before m then all other process has to deliver m' before m and if it does not happen it discards m. We can say m' has caused m in the above FIFO atomic broadcast.

(b)
No, because Uniform agreement(V) says if a CORRECT or NOT process delivers a message m, every correct process eventually delivers m. So for the wrong process it does not accept total order(XIII) i.e a wrong process can deliver m2 before m1 but in actual m1 should be delivered before m2.  
We can simplify it if we consider only causal ordering where m1 causes m2 or use consensus.
